        - 2. Use a Custom HTTP Header on CloudFront
            - X-Origin-Verify: xxxxxxxxx
        - 3. Set another WAF between CloudFront and ALB. This one will validate that the custom HTTP header meets the requirements
        - 4. Secret is stored on Secrets Manager, allowing auto-rotate. A Lambda Function will update the secrets on CloudFront and the filtering rule on the second WAF each time the secret is rotated

        - Using just a single public subnet
    - With ALB/NLB
        - 2 subnets: a public subnet, where the NACL + ALB/NLB reside, and a private subnet, where the EC2 is allocated.
    - ALB + WAF

        - At ALB level, you only allow all CloudFront public IPs on its SGs
        - Now, NACL is not helpful at all

    - **Placement Groups**
        - Control the EC2 Instance placement strategy using placement groups
        - Group Strategies
            - **Cluster**: group instances into a low-latency group in a single AZ
                - Same rack, same AZ
                    - **Pros**
                        - Great network (10 Gbps)
                            - Choose instance type that has Enhanced Networking to leverage on this feature
                    - **Cons**:
                        - If the rack fails, all instances fails at the same time
                - **Use cases**
                    - Big Data jobs that need to complete fast
                    - Apps that require extremely low latency and high network throughput

                - **Pros**
                    - Can span across AZs
                    - Reduced risk is simultaneous failure
                    - EC2 instances are on different physical HW
                - **Cons**
                    - Limited to 7 instances per AZs per placement group
                - **Use cases**
                    - App that require to maximize high availability
                    - Critical Applications where each instance **MUST** be isolated from failure from each other
            - **Partition**: spreads instances across many different partitions within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per groups.
                - Good for distributed databases such as Cassandra, Hadoop, Kafka (HDFS).
                - Up to 7 partitions per AZ. Up to 100s of EC2 instances per partition.
                - The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions
                - A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won't affect other partitions
                - EC2 instances get access to the partition info using EC2 Metadata service

            - Stop -> *modify-instance-placement* -> start
    - **Instance Launch Types**

    - **EC2 metrics**
        - **CPU** -> CPU Utilization + Credit Usage / Balance
        - **Network** -> Network In / Out
        - **Status check** -> Instance status (check EC2 VM) + System status (check the underlying HW)
            - In case of failing system status, you can monitor the instance using CloudWatch and trigger an alarm (*StatusCheckFailed_System*). Then **EC2 Instance Recovery** recovers the instance, keeping it the same private, public and Elastic IP, metadata and placement group
        - **Disk**: R/W for Ops / Bytes (only for instance store)
        - **RAM is NOT including in the AWS EC2 metrics**

    - 90% discount compared to On Demand
    - Define a maximum spot price and get the instance while *current spot price < max*
        - The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
        - You can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2 minutes grace period when price go high
    - Used for batch jobs, data analysis or workload that are resilient to failures
        - Not great for critical jobs or databases
    - **Spot Fleets**
        - Set of Spot Instances + On Demand instances (optional)
            - Automatic request Spot Instances with the lowest price
            - It try to meet target capacity with price constraints
                - Define possible launch pools: instance type, OS, AZ...
                - Multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
                - Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
        - Strategies to allocate Spot Instances
            - **lowestPrice** -> cost optimization, short workload
            - **diversified** -> great for get availability, long workloads
            - **capacityOptimized** -> pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
            - **priceCapacityOptimized (recommended)** -> pools with highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (best choice for most workloads)
